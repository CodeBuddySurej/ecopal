            <p>Deforestation in North America has been a significant concern in recent years, with various factors contributing to the decline of forests in the region. Between 2010 and 2020, the US forests increased 0.03% annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO)

                . However, deforestation in the United States has been a long-standing issue, with the country losing 75% of its virgin forests since the 1600s
                
                . In 2021, the US lost 4.22 million acres of forest, equivalent to 775 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions
                
                .

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Deforestation in North America has significant environmental impacts, including contributing to climate change, soil erosion, and habitat destruction. Deforestation leads to the loss of habitats for countless plant and animal species, threatening their survival and reducing overall biodiversity. The loss of forests also affects the water cycle, leading to decreased water quality and increased flooding. Deforestation in North America contributes to increased carbon and greenhouse gas emissions, impacting global climate patterns. The main causes of deforestation in North America include agricultural expansion, logging and wood extraction, urbanization, and climate change. Despite some efforts to implement sustainable forest management practices and laws and regulations to protect forest resources, more action is needed to address the complex issue of deforestation in North America</p>

                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p> The United States has implemented various measures to address deforestation, including the National Forest Management Act and the Endangered Species Act. The government collaborates with indigenous communities, conservation organizations, and industry stakeholders to promote sustainable forestry practices and implement various solutions to combat deforestation. Efforts have also been made to uphold the rights of frontline and Indigenous communities who face the most immediate harm from deforestation. These multifaceted strategies and collaborative endeavors aim to safeguard the country's invaluable forests for future generations</p>
