                <span>Why are landfills environmentally problematic?</span>
                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Landfills are environmentally problematic for several reasons. One of the most pressing concerns is their release of methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. Additionally, landfills can generate and release biogas into the atmosphere, which is a mixture primarily formed of methane gas and carbon dioxide, further contributing to global warming. Landfills also have the potential to contaminate soil and groundwater, leading to environmental pollution and health risks. The leachate from landfills, which is a liquid that has passed through the waste and contains various contaminants, can leak into the surrounding environment, causing further pollution. Furthermore, landfills can emit potentially harmful gases and odors that can permeate neighborhoods, leading to respiratory problems and other serious health issues for nearby residents
