                <span>What is the state of deforestation in Oceania?</span>
                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Oceania, which includes Australia, New Zealand, and various Pacific island nations, is home to about 22.5% or approximately 191,384,000 hectares of forest, according to the UN FAO. The region has experienced some level of deforestation, but the extent and causes vary by country. Australia, in particular, has been identified as a hotspot for deforestation, with significant impacts on wildlife and biodiversity. The loss of forests in Oceania has raised concerns about the region's environmental health and the need for conservation efforts to protect its unique ecosystems and species.

               <span>How does deforestation in Oceania affect the environment?</span>
                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Deforestation in Oceania has significant environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity, climate change, and decline in soil fertility. Australia, in particular, has lost almost 40 percent of its forests, leading to fragmentation of remaining forests and catastrophic loss of biodiversity. The physical process of cutting down forests affects the climate by releasing large amounts of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide into the air, contributing to rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns. Deforestation also causes a decline in soil fertility, with losses in organic carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulfur. Additionally, clearing forests can increase soil salinity, impacting water quality and plant life. The expansion of mining activities and urban development has also contributed to deforestation in the region, further exacerbating its environmental impact.</p>
