          <div class="text-component">
            <p>According to statistics, between 1990 and 2005, Asia lost approximately 40 million hectares of forest, representing a 12% decrease in forest cover. 
                Deforestation is especially severe in Southeast Asia, home to nearly 15% of the worldâ€™s tropical forests. The region has the highest deforestation rate in the world,
                 losing 1,2% of its forest annually. 
                Countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, and the Philippines have experienced significant deforestation. </p>

                <span>What are the key reasons of Deforestation in Asia?</span>
                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Key drivers of deforestation in Asia include agricultural expansion, logging for timber and pulp, infrastructure development, mining activities, and illegal logging. Agricultural practices, particularly for commodities like palm oil, soya, and rubber, have driven large-scale deforestation in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia. Logging, both legal and illegal, continues to be a significant cause of deforestation in many Asian countries.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p> Across Asia, there have been notable successes in combating deforestation. Governments, non-profit organisations, and local communities have collaborated on various initiatives, including forest landscape restoration programs, sustainable certification schemes, and community-led conservation projects.

                Forest landscape restoration efforts have demonstrated positive impacts, including biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, soil erosion prevention, and the restoration of ecosystem services. These projects also contribute to the sustainable development of local communities, providing employment opportunities and supporting livelihoods.</p>
