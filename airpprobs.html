          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Air pollution contributes to climate change by releasing pollutants, including greenhouse gases, into the atmosphere. These pollutants are often referred to as climate forcers and can result in changes to the climate
                
                . For example, ozone in the atmosphere warms the climate, while different components of particulate matter can have either warming or cooling effects on the climate
                
                . Black carbon, a particulate matter, is one of the largest contributors to global warming after carbon dioxide
                
                . Air pollution and climate change are two sides of the same coin, and they are typically addressed separately. However, they should be tackled jointly, with a focus on protecting people's health, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, to gain dual benefits: better air quality and improved health where we live, and the global benefit of mitigating climate change
                
                . Climate change can also affect air quality, as increases in outside air pollutants, such as ozone and particulate matter, could lead to higher indoor air pollution</p>

            <p>Air pollution can have significant impacts on human health. It is made up of tiny particles and gases that, when inhaled, can travel into the lungs and then into the bloodstream, affecting various organs such as the heart and brain. Air pollution has been linked to a range of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory issues such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Children, the elderly, and people with existing heart and lung conditions are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. Exposure to high levels of particulate matter, for example, can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections, and aggravated asthma from short-term exposure, while long-term or chronic exposure to fine particulate matter increases the risk of various diseases, including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia.

                Air pollution is caused by a variety of factors, both human-made and natural. Human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels, industrial processes, and agricultural practices are major contributors to air pollution. For example, vehicle emissions, fuel oils, and natural gas used to heat homes, by-products of manufacturing and power generation, particularly coal-fueled power plants, and fumes from chemical production are primary sources of human-made air pollution. Additionally, the use of household cleaning products and paints containing toxic chemicals, as well as the burning of wood and coal, can also contribute to air pollution. Natural sources of air pollution include smoke from wildfires, ash and gases from volcanic eruptions, and gases emitted from decomposing organic matter in soils. These factors release hazardous substances into the air, such as smoke, ash, and gases, which can have a significant impact on air quality and human health.
