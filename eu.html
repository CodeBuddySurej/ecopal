            <p>Europe has lost more than half of its forests in the past 6,000 years. This has primarily been due to agricultural expansion and demand for wood fuel.[79] According to satellite data, the loss of biomass in EUâ€™s forests increased by 69% in the period from 2016 to 2018, compared with the period from 2011 to 2015.</p>

               <span>How does deforestaion in Europe affect the environment?</span>

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Deforestation in Europe has significant environmental consequences, including being a main driver of climate change and biodiversity loss. Forests play a crucial role in absorbing CO2, regulating the water cycle, and providing habitats for biodiversity. When forests are cleared, the stored carbon is released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and global warming. Additionally, deforestation leads to the loss of habitats for countless plant and animal species, threatening their survival and reducing overall biodiversity. The European Union has recognized the impact of its consumption on deforestation and has taken steps to address this issue, such as implementing regulations to limit the importation of goods associated with deforestation. Efforts to combat deforestation in Europe reflect the EU's commitment to addressing this environmental challenge and promoting sustainable forest management practices</p>
