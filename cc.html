          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The causes of climate change are primarily attributed to human activities, particularly the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere since the Industrial Revolution. This is mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and gas, which produces carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide. Deforestation and land-use changes, as well as agricultural practices and livestock farming, also contribute to the release of greenhouse gases. While natural processes, such as changes in the sun's energy and volcanic eruptions, can affect the Earth's climate, they do not fully explain the observed warming since the mid-20th century, which is primarily attributed to human activities. The increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere has led to the greenhouse effect, trapping heat and causing global warming, which in turn drives climate change.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Air pollution can have significant impacts on human health. It is made up of tiny particles and gases that, when inhaled, can travel into the lungs and then into the bloodstream, affecting various organs such as the heart and brain. Air pollution has been linked to a range of health problems, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and respiratory issues such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Children, the elderly, and people with existing heart and lung conditions are particularly vulnerable to the effects of air pollution. Exposure to high levels of particulate matter, for example, can lead to reduced lung function, respiratory infections, and aggravated asthma from short-term exposure, while long-term or chronic exposure to fine particulate matter increases the risk of various diseases, including stroke, heart disease, lung cancer, and pneumonia.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>The potential economic impacts of climate change are significant and wide-ranging. As the global mean temperature rises, various sectors will be adversely impacted, such as agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor. Taken together, these effects could cost roughly 0.7 percent of GDP for every 1°F increase in temperature on average. Overall, climate change will harm the U.S. economy, even with modest amounts of warming. The U.S. economy would stand to lose between about 1 percent to 4 percent of GDP annually by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. The poorest third of counties in the United States are projected to experience damages costing and substantially widening the income gap between rich and poor parts of the country. Southern, coastal states will experience substantial, detrimental effects from climate change, including higher temperatures and exposure to coastal storms. Additionally, climate change can entail significant risks to macrofinancial stability. Nonfinancial corporate sectors face risks from climate damages and stranded assets—such as coal. Infrastructure will need to be upgraded to enhance economic resilience. Damage to other countries around the globe will also affect U.S. business through disruption in trade and supply chains. Overall, climate change has the potential to do significant economic harm and poses worrying tail risks.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Climate change has significant impacts on wildlife and ecosystems. Rising temperatures affect the survival rates of many species due to changes in food availability, successful reproduction, and suitable habitats. As plants adapt to changing warming patterns, wildlife must also adapt, which can lead to new environments and increased competition from invasive species. Climate change can also increase the spread of invasive species, which can outcompete native plants and animals, bring in new diseases, and cause other problems. In addition to affecting wildlife, climate change can also impact ecosystems by altering the balance between predators and prey, disrupting pollination, and affecting the distribution and abundance of various species. The Earth is currently experiencing a mass extinction event, with up to 60% of the world's species at risk of going extinct due to climate change
                
                . Addressing these impacts requires a comprehensive approach that includes mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, implementing policies to protect wildlife and ecosystems, and raising public awareness about the importance of preserving biodiversity and ecosystem health.

          <div class="text-component">
            <p>
                Some of the key greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), and water vapor (H2O)

. These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to the greenhouse effect and global warming. The primary sources of these greenhouse gases include the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial processes


. The greenhouse potential of each gas is measured in terms of their ability to absorb energy and radiate it, as well as their atmospheric lifetime, which determines how long the gas stays in the atmosphere before natural processes remove it

. While water vapor is a natural greenhouse gas, its inclusion in this list is due to its significant impact on climate feedbacks
