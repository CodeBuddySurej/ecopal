            <p>Africa is one of the most diverse continents for land use, with the territory split between cropland, forests, grassland, wetland, and human settlements. Grassland and forests together make up more than 50% of the whole continent, while desert, barren, and unproductive areas – classified as ‘other land’ – represent  32.4% of the total land area.

                Africa is the world’s third largest continent for global forest area, most of which is concentrated in central and southern countries characterised by a tropical climate like Zambia, Angola, Tanzania, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The latter has the world’s second-largest rainforest: boasting an area five times the size of France and with nearly 152 million hectares of forests, the Congo Basin has been renamed the ‘lungs of the planet’.  </p>

               <span>How does deforestaion in Africa affect the environment?</span>
                <div class="cd-faq__content">
          <div class="text-component">
            <p>Deforestation in Africa has severe consequences for the climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity of the continent. The ability of Africa to combat climate change is greatly affected by the loss of forests, as they play a crucial role in absorbing carbon dioxide and generating rainfall. This leads to increased vulnerability to droughts and exacerbates the long-standing water crisis in Africa. Kenya, located in East Africa, has experienced a significant rise in deforestation rates, resulting in more frequent and severe droughts. Additionally, the absence of soil cover exposes the land to erosion and degradation, intensifying the occurrence and impact of floods. Forests act as natural sponges, absorbing rainfall during tropical storms. Without sufficient tree cover, flooding becomes more likely. Both soil erosion and flooding have detrimental effects on agricultural productivity and food security across the continent.

                However, the impact of deforestation extends beyond the climate. Biodiversity is also greatly affected, with animals being among the most vulnerable victims. Deforestation leads to habitat loss and a scarcity of food for many species. The pygmy elephant, with a global population of only around 30,000 individuals, is one such species threatened by deforestation in Africa. The West African chimpanzee has seen a decline in population numbers by over 80% in just three generations and now faces a high risk of extinction. The mountain gorilla, with a population of only 1,000 remaining in the volcanic slopes of Rwanda, Uganda, and the DRC, is also at risk. Additionally, the West African lion, with a population slightly above 400 animals, is severely impacted by deforestation. The loss of these species not only disrupts the delicate balance of ecosystems but also diminishes the cultural and ecological heritage of Africa.</p>

            <p> The Great Green Wall Initiative, an ambitious plan was launched in 2007 to plant millions of trees across an 8,000km-long corridor in the Sahel to rescue the extremely vulnerable region from the devastating consequences of climate change. Planting trees, experts believe, could moderate temperatures, wind patterns and soil erosion as well as increasing humidity for agriculture. While the initiative had almost reached a standstill, a massive economic boost in 2021 brought new hope for the project’s completion.</p>
